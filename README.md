### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Sanjo and i'm passionate about creating things for the internet. My journey to web development started about 2019, when i tried to work on a Wordpress theme for my personal use, the freedom of creating any design i want without limit made me a programmer.

Now, with the help of freelancing platform, have had the privilege's of utilizing my skills for both startup and existing companies to create a responsive, fast and user friendly website for their users day to day usage.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

My expertise includes :
TailwindCSS
Javascript
