### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Sanjo and I'm passionate about creating things for the Internet. My journey to web development started about 2019, when I tried to work on a WordPress theme for my personal use, the freedom to create any design I wanted without limit made me a programmer.

Now, with the help of a freelancing platform, have had the privilege of utilizing my skills for both startup and existing companies to create a responsive, fast and user-friendly website for their users day to day usage.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

My expertise includes :
TailwindCSS
Javascript
Typescript
React
ExpressJs
Nodejs
MongoDB
Nextjs
